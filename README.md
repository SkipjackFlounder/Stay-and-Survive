A list of towers that you can build can be found in Source/Instructions

Some things to know:

Make sure you understand that shift causes rapid fire.
Start building turrets quickly in the beginning when the enemies are weak.

Make sure you upgrade the lasers at least a few times, but there a few points to understand:
1. The absolute damage increases at a diminishing rate when upgraded.
2. All lasers are upgraded, including the turrets.
3. The storage capacity for the laser increases at an exponential rate when upgraded.
When the laser hits twice its initial damage after three upgrades, you get black laser beams. 

Since the missile pack becomes worse over time, it's sometimes worth saving up for a laser upgrade instead, which provides 5 missiles every time. 

The laser tower is useful when your laser reaches a large capacity after many laser upgrades.
The hospital tower is only really useful if you get low on health, but it's really slow, so it requires upgrades.

The way to upgrade the towers is to place parts directly on the laser/hospital in the same shape.
